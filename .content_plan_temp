Executive stance

Positioning line:
Builder CIO with Linux and networking roots. I turn AI and operations into outcomes, transform organisations at scale, and build sustainable ventures. Founder at 1310. Community builder in education and search and rescue.

Three signature proof points to lead with everywhere

Organisation transformation: Rebuilt Pax8 internal IT from a single region service into a worldwide, pod based, product oriented organisation.

Founder discipline: Built 1310 self funded and organically into a profitable, self sustaining ISP.

Community outcomes: Turned around Reading Hackspace to consistent monthly surplus and 300+ members, and created the first UK drones in search and rescue playbook and qualification with Police and Lowland Rescue teams.

These are your differentiators. They should be visible within 5 seconds on sjg.io and in the first paragraph of your LinkedIn About.

sjg.io, rebuilt

Use sjg.io as the canonical, no-nonsense landing page. Make it fast, minimal, and outcome focused. Either Webflow with a clean Client‑First system for speed, or Astro/Next.js on Vercel for developer control with MDX. Keep the stack boring and the copy sharp.

About page, condensed narrative

I am a technology leader, not a software engineer. My roots are in Linux and networking. I started at Bluhalo, supporting large scale PHP and Perl websites on Linux hosting for Premier League football clubs, early ecommerce, and fashion brands. I learned reliability under load and the discipline of simple, observable systems.
I co‑founded and later exited Wirehive, then built 1310 as a self funded fibre ISP that is now profitable and self sustaining. At Pax8 I lead Technology Services, focusing on operational AI, automation, and a product oriented, pod based organisation that supports a global business.
I care about community. I helped turn around Reading Hackspace from near closure to a healthy monthly surplus with more than 300 members. I created the first UK playbook and qualification for drones in search and rescue with Police and Lowland Rescue teams. I serve as a long standing governor of the Bishopswood Infant and Junior School Federation, and chair collaboration across five schools in the Synergy Schools Partnership. I am working to start a forest school and am making property investments to support SEN schooling needs.
My approach is practical. Make the right path the easy one, measure what matters, and build trust in the plumbing.

About summary

I am a builder CIO, not a software engineer. My roots are in Linux and networking, starting at Bluhalo supporting large scale PHP and Perl sites for major brands under real load.
At Pax8 I transformed internal IT from a single region service into a product oriented, pod based organisation with worldwide coverage. I focus on operational AI, automation, adoption, and the plumbing that builds trust.
I built 1310 as a self funded ISP that is now profitable and self sustaining. I helped turn around Reading Hackspace to a monthly surplus with more than 300 members. I created the first UK playbook and qualification for drones in search and rescue with Police and Lowland Rescue teams. I serve as a long standing school governor and chair collaboration across five schools, with a special focus on SEN and a new forest school initiative.
I like systems that work, procedures that scale, and teams that ship.

Skills to pin

Operational AI, IT service management, platform engineering, Linux, networking, organisational design, incident response, governance.

Thought leadership programme

Anchor three pillars and rotate them weekly. Keep posts concise, with a diagram or single data point when available.

Pillar 1: Operational AI, not theatre

The routing layer that makes agentic systems safe.

How we choose between Copilot Studio, Power Platform, and custom agents.

What to measure weekly to know AI is doing real work.

Pillar 2: Organisation design and IT that ships

From single region service to product pods, what changed and what stayed the same.

Ownership, on‑call, and service catalogues that people actually use.

Reducing ticket volume by making the right path easy.

Pillar 3: Builder roots and community

Lessons from Linux and networking that still apply to AI.

The drones in search and rescue playbook, procedures that translate to enterprise reliability.

Turning a community around, how that informs team culture and governance.

Twelve ready prompts

Three decisions that make product oriented pods work across time zones.

Why I still care about DNS, routing, and logs when people want to talk models.

What I look for in a runbook and why most fail under pressure.

The first 90 days of an internal IT transformation and how to earn trust.

Self funded growth, constraints as a feature, and why it matters for enterprise IT.

The one metric that predicted adoption of our agents.

Drones in search and rescue, what enterprises can learn about procedures.

Community turnarounds, value creation before governance.

When to centralise and when to federate, lessons from pods.

How to avoid dashboard creep and ship action instead.

Building a small ISP taught me more about incident response than any book.

Why I do not call myself a software engineer, and why that helps as a CIO.

Visual content and assets

Headshot: neutral background, light smile, square and 3:2 crops.

Banner: your line “Make the right path the easy one” small in the corner.

Diagrams: simple block diagrams in black and white. No noisy colour.

Community photo: one unobtrusive image referencing drones or a workshop, no identifiable minors.

SEO and page copy discipline

Primary phrases: builder CIO, operational AI, product oriented pods, Linux and networking, drones in search and rescue, school governor, SEN support.

Title tags within 60 characters, meta descriptions within 160.

Each page has one H1 and a short first paragraph that states the outcome, not the tool.

Add Person JSON‑LD on Home, Article on posts, and a simple Organization for 1310 mentions.

Privacy and risk hygiene

Remove any residential addresses from public filings going forward by using a service address.

No family details or school pupil images.

On drones, stick to process and safety principles, avoid operational detail that should remain within SAR organisations.
