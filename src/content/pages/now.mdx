## Current work

**Operational AI at Pax8**: Building the layer that makes agentic systems safe and measurable in enterprise operations. Focus on patterns, adoption, and outcomes that matter.

**1310 ISP**: Supporting [Matt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewiggo/) as he builds our profitable, self-funded fibre ISP. Steady growth, disciplined engineering, sensible capital allocation.

## Learning and exploring

**Measurement frameworks**: Defining metrics that truly indicate AI is doing real work, not just vanity metrics. Focus on toil reduction, service quality, and business outcomes.

**AI productivity tooling influx**: Closely monitoring the rapid arrival of AI-enabled productivity tools. Looking for opportunities to pilot, integrate, or build on these at Pax8 where they can drive measurable impact.
