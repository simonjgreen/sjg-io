## Current work

**Operational AI at Pax8**: Building the routing layer that makes agentic systems safe and measurable in enterprise operations. Focus on patterns, adoption, and outcomes that matter.

**Product-oriented pods**: Continuing to refine our global, pod-based IT organisation. Measuring adoption, reliability, and speed across our worldwide footprint.

**1310 ISP**: Maintaining our profitable, self-funded fibre ISP. Steady growth, disciplined engineering, sensible capital allocation.

## Learning and exploring

**AI tool selection**: Deep dive into when to use Copilot Studio vs Power Platform vs custom agents. Building decision frameworks based on integration complexity, customization needs, and ROI.

**Measurement frameworks**: Defining metrics that truly indicate AI is doing real work, not just vanity metrics. Focus on toil reduction, service quality, and business outcomes.

**Communication as product**: Applying CI/CD principles to leadership communication. Weekly rhythm, measurable outcomes, continuous improvement.
