## 💼 Work

**Operational AI at [Pax8](/work/pax8)**: Building the layer that makes agentic systems safe and measurable in enterprise operations. Focus on patterns, adoption, and outcomes that matter.

**Workflow Engineering**: Leading the transformation of how we build, deploy, and operate software at scale. Creating systems that enable teams to move fast while maintaining reliability.

## 🚀 Side Projects

**1310 ISP**: Supporting [Matt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewiggo/) as he builds our profitable, self-funded fibre ISP. Steady growth, disciplined engineering, sensible capital allocation.

**sjg.io**: This site - continuously improving, experimenting with new content formats, and maintaining a fast, accessible web presence. Bit of a toy for me right now :)

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family & Life

**Bishopswood School Federation**: Continuing as [school governor](/work/school-governor), focusing on SEN support and the [forest school initiative](/work/forest-school). Chairing collaboration across five schools in the Synergy Schools Partnership.

**Property investments**: Building a portfolio to support SEN schooling needs and community initiatives.

## 📚 Learning & Exploring

**Measurement frameworks**: Defining metrics that truly indicate AI is doing real work, not just vanity metrics. Focus on toil reduction, service quality, and business outcomes.

**AI productivity tooling influx**: Closely monitoring the rapid arrival of AI-enabled productivity tools. Looking for opportunities to pilot, integrate, or build on these at Pax8 where they can drive measurable impact.

**Currently reading**: "Agentic Design Patterns" by Antonio Gulli ([read here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rsaK53T3Lg5KoGwvf8ukOUvbELRtH-V0LnOIFDxBryE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.pxcur8v2qagu)) [Thanks Eric!]
