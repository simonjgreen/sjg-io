title: "1310"
description: Built a self-funded, profitable, and self-sustaining ISP from the ground up, inspired by the need for connectivity companies that shared our values.
---

When we started Wirehive, we wished there was a connectivity company like us—one that shared our values and made it easy to do business and understand the world of connectivity. Despite the years that passed, we believed that business still didn't exist, so we decided to make it ourselves. That company is 1310.

## The Vision: Connectivity Done Right

1310 was born from a simple frustration: the connectivity industry was unnecessarily complex, opaque, and often didn't align with how we wanted to do business. We saw an opportunity to build an ISP that embodied the same principles we'd applied at Wirehive: clarity, reliability, and genuine partnership with customers.

Using our deep understanding of technology and experience of running and growing a hosting business, our aim was to make it simple, easy, and affordable for businesses to get high-speed, reliable Internet connectivity.

## Technical Foundation: Building Our Own Network

We achieved this vision by establishing a direct relationship with Openreach and unbundling local exchanges, allowing us to provide connectivity powered by our own network and infrastructure. This approach gave us:

- **Direct Control**: Full control over our network infrastructure and service delivery
- **Quality Assurance**: Ability to maintain high standards without relying on third-party networks
- **Cost Efficiency**: Direct relationships with infrastructure providers, passing savings to customers
- **Service Innovation**: Freedom to design services that actually met business needs

## The Name: 1310 Nanometres

1310, pronounced "thirteen-ten," is inspired by the wavelength of light (1310 nanometres) used in the delivery of fibre optic connectivity. This technical reference reflects our engineering-first approach and deep respect for the underlying technology that makes modern connectivity possible.

## Business Model: Sustainable Growth

From day one, 1310 was built with sustainability in mind:

- **Self-Funded Growth**: No external investment, growing organically through customer revenue
- **Disciplined Capital Allocation**: Every investment was measured against clear ROI and customer value
- **Steady Execution**: Focus on reliable service delivery over rapid expansion
- **Customer Retention**: Building long-term relationships rather than chasing short-term growth

- **Competitive Advantage**: Direct network control and engineering discipline set us apart from larger, more bureaucratic competitors

## Philosophy: Engineering Discipline Meets Business Sense

My approach at 1310 was rooted in the same principles that guided Wirehive:

- **Clarity over Complexity**: Making connectivity simple to understand and manage
- **Reliability over Features**: Focusing on core service excellence rather than feature bloat
- **Partnership over Transaction**: Building long-term relationships with customers
- **Engineering Excellence**: Maintaining high technical standards in all aspects of the business

## Lessons Learned

Building 1310 taught me several key lessons about sustainable business growth:

- **Capital Efficiency**: How to grow a technology business without external funding
- **Infrastructure Investment**: The importance of owning key parts of your value chain

## The Legacy

1310 demonstrated that it's possible to build a profitable, self-sustaining technology business through:

The experience of building 1310 reinforced my belief that the best technology businesses are built on solid foundations: reliable infrastructure, clear processes, and genuine customer value. These principles continue to guide my approach to technology leadership today.

## Current Status
