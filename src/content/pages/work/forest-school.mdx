title: "Forest School Project"
description: "I'm developing a forest school on ten acres of privately owned woodland, with the aim of opening in 2026. The project is still in the planning stage, but the vision is clear: to create a safe, inspiring, and inclusive space where children with special educational needs can thrive."

## The Motivation

The motivation comes from what I see every time I'm in a school as a Governor: the state system is under strain, and many SEN children are not getting the support they deserve. Forest school offers something different â€” time in nature, space to breathe, and opportunities to learn and grow through hands-on experience.

## Our Approach

This isn't about building a profit-driven venture. The school will run on a cost-plus basis, working directly with local schools to provide sessions that are affordable and sustainable, while still ensuring high-quality provision and trained staff.

## Current Development

Between now and launch, I'm working on site design, safeguarding, training, and the necessary permissions. The goal is to open the gates in 2026 and begin welcoming groups of children to the woods.

## Get Involved

If you're an educator, parent, or partner organisation who would like to be involved, I'd love to hear from you.
