I co-founded Wirehive and served as CTO during the company's scale-up years, building it into a leading cloud consulting and managed services provider before it was acquired by Pax8 in 2020.

## Company Overview

Wirehive was a radically candid cloud consulting company that helped businesses solve technology challenges through straight-talking tech specialists. We focused on making technology work for business outcomes, not just for technology's sake.

## Key Contributions as CTO

- **Architecture Leadership**: Designed and implemented scalable cloud architectures for enterprise clients
- **Service Design**: Built clarity into our service delivery model, ensuring predictable outcomes for clients
- **Technical Strategy**: Led the technical vision for cloud migration, AI/ML initiatives, and modern workplace solutions
- **Team Building**: Scaled the engineering and technical consulting teams during rapid growth
- **Client Delivery**: Ensured successful delivery of complex cloud transformation projects

## Services and Expertise

During my time at Wirehive, we delivered:

- **Cloud Migration**: Seamless infrastructure migration to AWS, Azure, and GCP
- **AI and Data Initiatives**: Jumpstart programs for pilot AI projects and data-led initiatives
- **Modern Workplace**: Technology strategy and implementation for remote working and digital transformation
- **Managed Cloud Services**: Ongoing support and optimization for cloud environments

## Notable Client Work

We worked with organizations including:
- **University of Surrey**: Cloud migration with agile delivery approach
- **Graham & Brown**: E-commerce platform that increased revenue by 180%
- **World Vision**: Migration of the world's largest charity to Amazon Web Services
- **Kepler Wolf**: Technology audit that discovered Â£1.5m revenue opportunity

## Acquisition by Pax8

Wirehive was acquired by Pax8 in 2020, bringing our cloud consulting expertise and client relationships into Pax8's ecosystem. This acquisition was a natural fit, combining Wirehive's consultative approach with Pax8's platform capabilities.

## Philosophy and Approach

My approach at Wirehive was rooted in:
- **Clarity over Complexity**: Making technology decisions transparent and understandable
- **Outcomes over Outputs**: Focusing on business results, not just technical achievements
- **Partnership over Vendor**: Working as true partners with clients, not just service providers
- **Practical Innovation**: Implementing cutting-edge technology in ways that actually work

The experience of building and scaling Wirehive taught me the importance of clear architecture, thoughtful service design, and the discipline of making complex technology accessible and reliable for business users.
