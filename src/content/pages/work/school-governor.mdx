# School Governance & Education

I have been a long-standing school governor for Bishopswood Infant and Junior School, where I have supported leadership teams in strategy, finance, and governance. Over the years, my involvement has extended beyond the individual schools into shaping collaboration across a wider network.

As Chair of the Collaboration Committee for the Synergy Schools Partnership, I have worked with five schools to develop stronger links, share best practice, and ensure consistency in areas such as safeguarding, curriculum development, and resource planning.

This role has given me the opportunity to:

- Support school leaders in raising educational outcomes for children.
- Strengthen governance structures to balance accountability with support.
- Foster collaboration across schools, ensuring that resources and ideas flow freely to benefit pupils, staff, and the wider community.
- Champion the importance of resilience, innovation, and inclusion in education.

My time as a governor has been both humbling and rewarding, offering a window into the challenges and opportunities faced by schools today. It has also allowed me to bring skills from business and technology into an educational context, helping leadership teams to think about long-term sustainability and new ways of working.
