description: "Driving an AI-era transformation of technology, workflows, and enablement at scale"

Pax8 is where I do my best work at scale. After leading as CIO, I’ve pivoted to focus full-time on **AI, automation, and workflow engineering** - shaping how Pax8 reimagines work in the AI era.

## My role

I now serve as **SVP, Workflow Engineering**, building on my experience as CIO to concentrate on three things:  
- **Enablement.** Giving every Pax8 team modern tools and patterns to radically enhance the way they work.  
- **Automation.** Designing and operating mission-critical workflows that touch the lead-to-cash pipeline and other complex, multi-functional processes.  
- **Orchestration.** Running Pax8’s citizen development ecosystem, with the platforms and guardrails that let Pax8ers move fast with AI-driven automation.

It’s a strategic shift: from owning broad IT and operations to making **flow** - the movement of work, data, and decisions - a discipline in its own right.

## What I'm building

**A Workflow Engineering discipline.** Turning messy, cross-department work into reliable, observable flows using automation platforms and agentic patterns.  

**AI at the core of daily work.** Equipping teams with agents, retrieval services, and orchestration tools so they can spend less time on toil and more time on judgment.  

**A thriving citizen developer ecosystem.** Empowering Pax8ers to build their own automations safely, with shared components, templates, and clear guardrails.

## Focus areas for 2025–2026

* **Enablement at scale.** Helping every team adopt AI-era tools and patterns - why shouldn’t finance write Python if it accelerates insight?  
* **Mission-critical automation.** Oversight of the automations that keep Pax8 running - especially those in lead-to-cash and other high-leverage flows.  
* **Orchestration and governance.** Operating the citizen automation ecosystem so innovation thrives without creating chaos.  
* **Developer experience.** Paved roads, golden paths, and documentation that make the right way the easy way.  

## Principles

* **Urgency.** Deliver value this week, not just next quarter.  
* **Accountability.** Clear owners, visible outcomes, measurable flow.  
* **Trust.** Fewer surprises, more transparency.  
* **CI/CD mindset.** Treat playbooks, platforms, and communications as living systems - iterate constantly.  

## Selected initiatives

* **Pods re-organisation.** Moving from a single IT team to globally distributed pods aligned to outcomes.  
* **Citizen automation programme.** Safe, governed enablement of Pax8ers to build their own automations and agents.  
* **AI Core services.** Shared building blocks for retrieval, actioning, and orchestration that everyone can use.  
* **Microsoft collaboration.** Joint work on Copilot adoption, Copilot Studio agents, and SMB-focused security offerings.  
* **Knowledge and search.** Baseline health checks of Microsoft Search and Graph connectors to make knowledge discoverable.  
* **TechTok comms.** Short-form internal updates to keep progress human and visible.  

## Outcomes I care about

* Shorter time from idea to impact.  
* Reliable, observable, end-to-end flows.  
* Teams enabled with the confidence to use automation directly.  
* Happier Pax8ers, happier partners, and fewer handoffs lost in the cracks.
