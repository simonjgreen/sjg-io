# Pax8

Pax8 is where I do my best work at scale. I lead technology and operations change with a practical focus on outcomes for small and midsize businesses, the partners who serve them, and the people who keep everything running day to day.

## My role

I serve as Chief Information Officer at Pax8. After the Wirehive acquisition, I focused on reshaping our internal technology capability and setting the path for an AI-enabled Pax8. Today my remit spans Technology Services and the AI Transformation Office, bringing people, process, and platforms together so we deliver faster and with higher quality.

## What I'm building

**A product-centred, global technology organisation.** We shifted from a single-region internal IT model to pods aligned to outcomes. The aim is clear ownership, shorter feedback loops, and continuous delivery across time zones.

**AI at the core of how we operate.** I'm standing up the AI Core and a Workflow Engineering practice so the right problems are automated first. We pair central capabilities with a safe, governed citizen-developer programme.

**Clear, human communication.** We use simple, repeatable formats to explain what's changing and why. "TechTok" short updates, working notes, and transparent roadmaps keep teams aligned.

## Focus areas for 2025â€“2026

* **Workflow Engineering.** A hands-on team that turns messy, cross-department work into reliable flows using modern automation platforms and agentic patterns.
* **AI Core.** Shared services for retrieval, actioning, and orchestration that product and operations teams can use without reinventing the wheel.
* **Service quality.** Better incident, request, and change handling using ServiceNow, with practical rubrics, coaching, and measurement.
* **Enablement at pace.** Buying tools is easy. Getting value is the hard bit. We invest in onboarding, playbooks, and measurable adoption so changes stick.

## Principles

* **Urgency.** Bias to shipping useful improvements this week.
* **Accountability.** Clear owners, crisp handoffs, visible metrics.
* **Trust.** Fewer surprises. More transparency and follow-through.
* **CI/CD mindset.** Treat communication, roadmaps, and playbooks like code. Iterate in small steps and keep everything current.

## Selected initiatives

* **Pods re-organisation.** Moved from one large team to smaller outcome-aligned pods with global coverage, improving ownership and flow of work.
* **Citizen automation.** Guard-railed programme for staff to build safe automations, backed by patterns, reviews, and a shared component library.
* **Microsoft partnership.** Ongoing work with Microsoft on Copilot adoption, Copilot Studio for custom agents, and shared exploration of an SMB-appropriate security offering.
* **Search and knowledge.** Health-check and baseline of Microsoft Search and Graph connectors to improve findability and reuse.
* **Internal comms.** Launched "TekTok" short-form updates to make technical progress visible and human.

## How I work with teams

* Keep scope small and value obvious.
* Automate the handoffs, not just the tasks.
* Write it down. Share the why, not just the what.
* Prefer open standards and platforms that play well with others.

## Outcomes I care about

* Shorter time from idea to impact.
* Fewer escalations and clearer ownership.
* Less swivel-chair work between systems.
* Happier engineers and happier customers.
