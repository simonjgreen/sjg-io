My career has always been about making complex technology usable, reliable, and scalable.

Today, I serve as **SVP of Workflow Engineering at Pax8**, leading the next generation of technology services with a focus on automation, AI, and outcome-driven operations. I’ve built the foundation for Pax8’s AI Transformation Office, designed our “AI Core,” and established patterns for multi-agent orchestration that turn theory into production-ready systems. My work centres on workflow engineering: reducing toil, improving adoption, and embedding automation into the everyday life of thousands of people.

Before this, I was Global Chief Information Officer at Pax8, where I reshaped a classic, single-region IT team into a modern, pod-based, product-oriented organisation with worldwide coverage. That experience showed me how much faster and safer we can move when ownership, feedback loops, and delivery are aligned to outcomes.

I believe the role of technology leadership is changing: it’s no longer just about running systems, but about building platforms that accelerate the business, enable innovation, and make the right path the easy one. At Pax8, that means creating an automation-first culture that scales across borders and empowers both our people and our partners.

Outside Pax8, I'm the founder of **1310**, a fibre ISP built organically and self-funded from the ground up. It’s now a profitable, self-sustaining business – proof that disciplined engineering and thoughtful growth can create long-term value without chasing hype.

Earlier in my career I was CTO at Wirehive, and before that I cut my teeth at Bluhalo, supporting large-scale PHP and Perl websites on Linux for Premier League clubs, ecommerce pioneers, and fashion brands. That foundation in infrastructure and reliability still shapes how I approach workflow design and automation today.

I’ve also contributed to community projects over the years, from turning around Reading Hackspace into a thriving 300-member organisation, to creating the UK’s first playbook for drones in search and rescue. Those experiences taught me the same lesson I apply in enterprise AI: governance, adoption, and repeatable processes matter more than tools or hype.

Now, my energy is on building globally scalable, AI-driven, automation-first services that deliver real outcomes for people and businesses.
