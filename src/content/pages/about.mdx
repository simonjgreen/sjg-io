My career has always been about making complex technology usable, reliable, and scalable.

Today, I serve as Global Chief Information Officer at Pax8, where I've led the transformation of our classic, single-region internal IT into a modern, pod-based, product-oriented organisation with worldwide coverage. My focus is on automation, workflow engineering, and operational AI — not experiments or theatre, but practical systems that reduce toil, improve adoption, and deliver measurable business outcomes.

I believe the role of a CIO is changing: it's no longer just about keeping the lights on. It's about building platforms and services that accelerate the business, enable innovation, and make the right path the easy one. At Pax8, that means deploying AI agents and automation patterns that integrate deeply into workflows and scale safely across thousands of people.

Outside Pax8, I'm the founder of 1310, a fibre ISP built organically and self-funded from the ground up. It's now a profitable, self-sustaining business — proof that disciplined engineering and thoughtful growth can create long-term value without chasing hype.

Earlier in my career I was CTO at Wirehive, and before that I cut my teeth at Bluhalo, supporting large-scale PHP and Perl websites on Linux for Premier League clubs, ecommerce pioneers, and fashion brands. That foundation in infrastructure and reliability still shapes how I approach technology leadership today.

I've also contributed to community projects over the years, from turning around Reading Hackspace into a thriving, 300-member organisation, to early work creating a playbook for drones in search and rescue. Those experiences taught me the same lesson I apply in enterprise IT: governance, adoption, and repeatable processes matter more than tools or hype.

Now, my energy is on building the next generation of technology services: AI-driven, automation-first, globally scalable, and always grounded in outcomes.
