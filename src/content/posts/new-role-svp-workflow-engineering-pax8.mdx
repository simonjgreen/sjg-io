**TL;DR** I've stepped into a new role at **Pax8** as **SVP, Workflow Engineering**.  
The mission is simple: make work at Pax8 faster, safer, and smarter. We'll do that by focusing on three outcomes:

1. **Enablement** equipping Pax8 teams with the modern tools and patterns to radically enhance the way they work.  
2. **Automation** overseeing, designing, and building mission-critical workflows that touch the lead-to-cash pipeline and other complex, multi-functional processes.  
3. **Orchestration** operating and governing our citizen development ecosystem, providing the tools and guardrails that let Pax8ers run fast with AI-era automation technologies.

## 1. Enablement
The future of work isn't about a small central team building every solution. It's about **every team having the ability to improve their own flow of work**.  

That could mean a finance analyst writing a short Python script, an operations team using an agent to automate handoffs, or support embedding AI directly into customer interactions.  

Workflow Engineering will provide the platforms, patterns, and confidence so Pax8ers can safely adopt these new ways of working shifting from "waiting on IT" to "using tech directly."

## 2. Automation
Some workflows are too critical or complex to leave to chance.  
The lead-to-cash pipeline, billing and provisioning flows, or multi-functional processes that span product, operations, and finance these need to be designed and operated as **first-class products**.  

Workflow Engineering will own the oversight, design, and build of these **mission-critical automations**, ensuring reliability, observability, and scalability by default.

## 3. Orchestration
Citizen development is powerful but without direction it can become chaotic.  

Our role is to **operate and orchestrate Pax8's citizen development ecosystem**:  
- Providing accessible tools and automation platforms.  
- Embedding guardrails for compliance and security.  
- Offering enablement and templates so Pax8ers can move quickly, without reinventing the wheel.  

The aim is a **healthy, self-sustaining ecosystem** where people across the company build automations and agents that improve their day-to-day work, while the platform ensures those automations are reliable and safe.

## What success looks like
- Teams adopting new patterns of work and reporting real productivity gains.  
- Mission-critical automations that are observable, resilient, and continuously improved.  
- A thriving citizen developer ecosystem where Pax8ers build confidently within the right guardrails.  

This is the next chapter of our journey at Pax8 blending automation, AI, and agentic systems into the everyday flow of work. I'll be sharing progress and lessons learned here..
