Most leadership updates arrive late, run long, and leave people guessing.
The work carries on, but the story lags behind it. Confidence drops. Doubts grow.

Treat communication like a product. Ship small. Ship weekly. Measure. Improve.

> **Promise:** With a simple pipeline and a weekly rhythm you can move from ad‑hoc updates to a steady flow of clarity. People will know what matters and why.

## Outcomes to aim for

* Everyone can answer: what changed, why it matters, what to do next.
* Fewer repeated questions in channels and meetings.
* Faster alignment inside and across pods.
* Leaders spend less time firefighting and more time deciding.

## The communication pipeline

Think CI/CD for comms. Keep the stages short and visible.

1. **Backlog:** Collect potential updates. Decisions made. Risks surfaced. Demos worth showing.
2. **Prioritise:** Pick one to three messages for the week. If everything is priority, nothing is.
3. **Draft:** Write the minimum viable update. Aim for two to three minutes if on video. 150 to 250 words if written.
4. **Review:** Quick pass by your EA and one PM for accuracy and plain English.
5. **Release:** Publish to one primary channel. Record a clean video or post a crisp note. Link to artefacts, not attachments.
6. **Measure:** Track reach and reaction. Capture questions.
7. **Improve:** Fold the learning into next week's backlog.

Keep each stage lightweight. Timebox the whole flow to a few hours per week.

## Formats that travel

* **Short video:** Two to three minutes. Face to camera. One graphic if needed.
* **Decision log entry:** One paragraph per decision. Include date, owner, the choice made, and how to reverse if needed.
* **Simple roadmap:** Screenshot or one slide. Use it as a pointer, not a wall of text.
* **Demo clip:** Under two minutes. Show the thing. Say what changed and what the viewer should do.

Pick one format per update. Resist the urge to bundle.

## Roles that make it work

* **Leader:** Chooses the messages. Records or signs off. Owns the quality bar.
* **EA:** Runs the pipeline. Protects time. Coordinates reviews. Publishes on schedule.
* **PMs:** Feed the backlog. Fact‑check. Provide artefacts and short demos.
* **SMEs:** Supply the one sentence that makes the complex simple.

Small team. Clear ownership.

## A weekly rhythm that sticks

* **Monday:** Ten‑minute editorial stand‑up. Confirm the one to three messages.
* **Tuesday:** Draft and review.
* **Wednesday:** Record or finalise copy.
* **Thursday:** Publish. Engage with questions for thirty minutes.
* **Friday:** Read the metrics. Note what to change next week.

Hold the slot. Treat it as a release.

## The quality bar

* One main message per update.
* Plain language. No jargon if a simpler word exists.
* Tell people what to do. Link them to where to do it.
* If it takes longer than three minutes to say, split it.
* Visuals help, but only if they reduce words.

## What to measure

Start simple. Track these every week.

* **Reach:** How many people saw it within 48 hours.
* **Watch‑through or read‑through:** How many made it to the end.
* **Action taken:** Clicks to the linked artefact. Sign‑ups. Ticket tags.
* **Repeat questions:** Count how often the same question appears after release. You want this going down.

Share the numbers openly. The point is learning, not theatre.

## Common traps

* **Over‑polish:** Perfect is slow. Slow loses attention.
* **Platform sprawl:** One primary channel. Cross‑post with a link only.
* **One‑way broadcast:** Always invite questions. Answer the first few fast.
* **Shifting the channel:** Do not move the audience around unless you must.
* **Heroic comms:** If you need a production crew, the process is too heavy.
* **Novelty for its own sake:** Repeat the working format. Change it when the numbers tell you to.

## A one‑week sprint template

Use this as a starting point. Adjust to your diary.

* **Monday:**

  * Confirm messages.
  * Check artefacts exist and links work.
* **Tuesday:**

  * Draft scripts or notes.
  * PM and EA review for clarity and accuracy.
* **Wednesday:**

  * Record the video or finalise copy.
  * Add captions or alt text.
* **Thursday:**

  * Publish at the same time each week.
  * Stay live for thirty minutes to triage questions.
* **Friday:**

  * Review metrics with EA and one PM.
  * Capture learnings. Update next week's backlog.

## Starter script for a 2 to 3 minute update

```text
Title: <Project or theme> – weekly update

1) What changed:
In the last week we <one‑line summary>. The visible impact is <one line>.
If you watch one thing: <link to demo or artefact>.

2) Why it matters:
This helps <audience or customer> by <outcome>.
It moves us closer to <objective or OKR>.

3) What to do next:
If you are in <team or role>: please <single action>.
If you are everyone else: <single action or "no action">.

Risks or asks:
We are watching <short risk>. We need <specific help> by <date>.

Thank you:
Shout‑out to <names or pod> for <specific contribution>.
```

Keep your tone human. Speak as if you are in the room. Smile. It reads through the screen.

## Comms release checklist

Use this before you press publish.

* [ ] One to three messages selected. Each fits in one sentence.

* [ ] Script or copy under three minutes to deliver.
* [ ] EA and PM review done. Names and dates correct.
* [ ] Call to action is clear and doable this week.
* [ ] Metrics from last week reviewed. One improvement applied.
* [ ] Primary channel chosen. Cross‑posts point back, not copy‑paste.
* [ ] Time booked to respond to first questions.

Good communication is not a broadcast. It is a product with a release cycle.
Run the cycle. Improve every week. Clarity will follow.
