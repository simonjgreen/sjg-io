summary: "What being 'computer literate' actually means in 2026, and exactly what to do about it."
---

It used to be enough to say you could use Word, send an email, and "do a spreadsheet."  
That‚Äôs not computer literacy anymore. The bar has moved.

Being *computer literate* in 2026 means you can keep yourself secure, use AI as a partner, and work confidently across platforms.  
You don‚Äôt need to be a programmer. You do need to understand the basics of how today‚Äôs tools think, talk, and connect.

This is a practical guide to getting there.

## 1. Security that resists phishing

Passwords are dying, and that‚Äôs a good thing. The problem isn‚Äôt that people forget them, it‚Äôs that they‚Äôre easy to steal. Even with two-factor authentication, you can still be tricked into handing over a code or approving a fake login. That‚Äôs why phishing-resistant authentication matters.

### What that means

When security people talk about "phishing-resistant MFA," they mean methods that can‚Äôt be bypassed by fake login pages. These rely on a cryptographic handshake between your device and the service, not a code you type in.

The easiest version of this for normal people is **passkeys**.  
A passkey is a digital key stored securely on your phone or laptop that proves it‚Äôs really you. You unlock it with your face, fingerprint, or PIN. You don‚Äôt type anything in, and the private part of the key never leaves your device.

If you want to understand how this works, start here:  
üëâ [What are passkeys and how do they work?](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/)

### What to do

1. **Turn on a passkey** for your main account. Use official guides:  
   - Google: [Use a passkey to sign in](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/13548313)  
   - Apple: [Use passkeys on iPhone and Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-passkeys-to-sign-in-to-websites-and-apps-iphf538ea8d0/ios) and [About passkey security](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102195)  
   - Microsoft: [Signing in with a passkey](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/signing-in-with-a-passkey-09a49a86-ca47-406c-8acc-ed0e3c852c6d) and [Windows passkeys overview](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/passkeys-overview-301c8944-5ea2-452b-9886-97e4d2ef4422)

2. **Add a hardware security key** for critical accounts.  
   - Yubico: [Getting started with YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/setup/)  
   - Google: [Use a security key for 2-Step Verification](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6103523)  
   - Microsoft: [Sign in with a security key](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/sign-in-to-your-account-with-a-security-key-b23a2a45-6ab8-4c86-9f22-bcadf60235aa)

3. **Avoid SMS codes where possible** and prefer phishing-resistant methods.  
   - Microsoft Learn: [Require phishing-resistant MFA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/policy-admin-phish-resistant-mfa)

4. **Use an independent password manager** and store passkeys there too.  
   - Bitwarden: [Store and use passkeys](https://bitwarden.com/help/storing-passkeys/) and [Passwordless with passkeys](https://bitwarden.com/passwordless-passkeys/)

Also keep in mind what I wrote in [Consolidation](https://sjg.io/writing/consolidation/) and [Consolidation Again](https://sjg.io/writing/consolidation-again/). The more we centralise everything behind a single identity provider, the more fragile the whole system becomes. Using your own password manager adds independence and resilience.

## 2. Using AI like a collaborator

AI isn‚Äôt just a faster search engine or a lazy shortcut for writing. It‚Äôs something new: a tool that helps you think. Working with it is more like having a conversation with yourself and someone else at the same time.

### How to work with it

The skill isn‚Äôt ‚Äúprompt engineering.‚Äù It‚Äôs learning to direct and critique the output.

1. **Pick something real.** Choose a task you already do: an email, a spreadsheet, a report.  
2. **Have a conversation.** Tell the AI what you are trying to achieve, not just what to produce. Ask for structure first, then detail.  
3. **Ask it to explain itself.** ‚ÄúWhy did you choose that structure?‚Äù, ‚ÄúExplain this formula.‚Äù Treat it like a smart colleague who might be wrong.  
4. **Refine, don‚Äôt accept.** Use the draft as scaffolding, then edit.

### Practical examples

- **Excel**  
  - Start here: [Get started with Copilot in Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-started-with-copilot-in-excel-d7110502-0334-4b4f-a175-a73abdfc118a)  
  - Python features: [Get started with Python in Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-started-with-python-in-excel-a33fbcbe-065b-41d3-82cf-23d05397f53d) and [Introduction to Python in Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/introduction-to-python-in-excel-55643c2e-ff56-4168-b1ce-9428c8308545)

- **Word**  
  - Drafting help: [Copilot in Word help](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot-word) and [Draft and add content with Copilot](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/draft-and-add-content-with-copilot-in-word-069c91f0-9e42-4c9a-bbce-fddf5d581541)

- **Outlook**  
  - Catch up faster: [Summarise an email thread with Copilot](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/summarize-an-email-thread-with-copilot-a79873f2-396b-46dc-b852-7fe5947ab640)

The people who will thrive with AI are the ones who co-write, co-analyse, and co-design. You don‚Äôt have to be an expert, just someone who can talk to the machine clearly and check its work.

## 3. Becoming a power user of your everyday tools

Most people use less than 20% of what their software can do. The rest is hidden behind menus or now, increasingly, behind AI.

A power user in 2026 is someone who can tell the computer what to do in plain English, get a result, and know enough to spot when it‚Äôs wrong.

### What that looks like

- You know that Excel can generate Python for analysis, not just formulas.  
- You can connect tools with low-code automation.  
- You can switch between Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile without panic because you understand files, networks, and security basics.

### What to do

1. **Learn one new feature this week.**  
   Ask your app to show you something it can automate. In Excel: create a pivot table and graph with Copilot.  
   - Excel Copilot: [Get started](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-started-with-copilot-in-excel-d7110502-0334-4b4f-a175-a73abdfc118a)

2. **Connect your tools.**  
   Build one small automation. For example, when a Notion page is updated, send a Slack notification.  
   - Power Automate: [Create a cloud flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/get-started-logic-flow) or [Get started training](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/get-started-flows/)  
   - Notion √ó Slack: [Notion Slack integration](https://www.notion.com/integrations/slack) and [Notion Help: Integrate Slack](https://www.notion.com/help/slack)  
   - Zapier option: [Zaps quick start guide](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/22234847450893-Zaps-quick-start-guide)

3. **Use shortcuts that save hours.**  
   Learn a handful of launcher or command features on your platform and practice them every day.  
   - Python in Excel editor: [Code editor basics](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/python-in-excel-code-editor-b74ac883-3bc1-4253-90cb-c1a09887acc1)

## 4. Data and digital sensemaking

Modern literacy means being comfortable reading data, not just text. You don‚Äôt have to write SQL or Python daily, but you should be able to look at a dashboard and spot trends, question anomalies, and talk about uncertainty.

### DO THIS

- **Open a dashboard you already use** and ask: what is this number actually telling me and what is missing.  
- **Check the source** and refresh cadence before you act.  
- **Learn one chart type properly** and when to use it. Clear charts make your point land.

---

## 5. Digital responsibility and awareness

Being literate in 2026 isn‚Äôt just technical. It is also about how you behave online, how you verify what you see, and how you respect privacy.

### DO THIS

- **Learn to spot and verify AI-generated media.**  
  - Content provenance: [Content Credentials overview](https://contentcredentials.org/) and [C2PA specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html)  
  - Verify media: [CAI verification portal](https://verify.contentauthenticity.org/)  
  - Reverse image search: [Google‚Äôs official guide](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1325808)

- **Share less.** Turn off default location sharing, review app permissions, and prune old data.

- **Assume bias exists.** Ask who benefits and who is disadvantaged before you accept an AI-driven result.

## 6. Ethics and critical thinking

Good tech skills are not enough. You need judgment.  
Being computer-literate in 2026 means being curious, skeptical, and able to separate signal from noise. Anyone can share or generate information now ‚Äî the skill is deciding what to trust.

### DO THIS

- **Vet the source before you share it.**  
  Always pause before reposting or quoting something. Ask: Who published it? What‚Äôs their evidence? Has anyone else confirmed it?  
  - Learn the method: Stanford‚Äôs [Civic Online Reasoning](https://cor.inquirygroup.org/) lessons teach quick source checks.  
  - Try structured media comparisons with [Ground News](https://ground.news/), which shows political lean and coverage bias across outlets.  
  - Take a short course at [Full Fact](https://fullfact.org/education/) on how to spot misquotes, manipulated stats, and viral nonsense.

- **Double-check claims fast.**  
  Use independent fact-checking sites instead of relying on what the algorithm shows first.  
  - Google‚Äôs [Fact Check Explorer](https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/explorer) lets you search verified fact checks.  
  - [Full Fact](https://fullfact.org/latest/) publishes daily UK-focused corrections and transparent evidence links.  
  - [Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/) and [Reuters Fact Check](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/) are solid for international stories.

- **Be critical of AI outputs.**  
  Large-language models are persuasive, not always truthful. Treat every confident answer as a *draft of reality*.  
  - **Check plausibility:** If it sounds surprising, ask for sources and then verify them.  
  - **Look for bias:** Does the answer favour one viewpoint, region, or demographic? Ask the AI to restate its response from another perspective.  
  - **Cross-reference:** Find the same fact on at least two independent sites. If you can‚Äôt, treat it as unverified.  
  - For a simple guide to everyday AI awareness, read Mozilla‚Äôs [*Everyday AI Guide*](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/insights/ai-guide/) and the UK ICO‚Äôs [*Practical tips for using AI safely*](https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online-and-on-social-media/using-ai-safely/).

Being critical doesn‚Äôt mean being cynical. It means thinking like an editor: checking facts, questioning sources, and keeping your curiosity switched on.

## What to do today

Don‚Äôt file this away as "something to look into later."  
Open your laptop or phone right now and do these three things:

1. **Turn on a passkey.**  
   Choose your platform and follow the official steps:  
   [Google](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/13548313) ¬∑ [Apple](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-passkeys-to-sign-in-to-websites-and-apps-iphf538ea8d0/ios) ¬∑ [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/signing-in-with-a-passkey-09a49a86-ca47-406c-8acc-ed0e3c852c6d)

2. **Use an AI tool for something real.**  
   Write a message, analyse a sheet, or plan a note with help from AI. If you use Microsoft 365, start with these:  
   [Copilot in Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-started-with-copilot-in-excel-d7110502-0334-4b4f-a175-a73abdfc118a) ¬∑ [Copilot in Word](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot-word) ¬∑ [Copilot in Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/summarize-an-email-thread-with-copilot-a79873f2-396b-46dc-b852-7fe5947ab640)

3. **Learn one new trick in an app you already use.**  
   In Excel, ask Copilot to explain a formula or generate a chart. If you are curious about Python in Excel, start here:  
   [Python in Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-started-with-python-in-excel-a33fbcbe-065b-41d3-82cf-23d05397f53d)

Do those three things today and you‚Äôll already be operating at the 2026 computer-literate level.

This isn‚Äôt a complete list of everything it takes to be computer-literate in 2026.  
It‚Äôs a focused snapshot ‚Äî the skills that someone who was comfortable in 2024 might not quite have down by the end of this year, but should start refining now.
