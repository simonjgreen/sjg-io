title: "The 2026 Computer-Literate Bar"
date: 2025-10-21
description: "What being 'computer literate' actually means in 2026, why it matters, and exactly what to do about it."
---

It used to be enough to say you could use Word, send an email, and "do a spreadsheet."  
That is not computer literacy anymore. The bar has moved.

Being *computer literate* in 2026 means you can keep yourself secure, use AI as a partner, and work confidently across platforms.  
You do not need to be a programmer. You do need to understand the basics of how today‚Äôs tools think, talk, and connect.

This is a practical guide to getting there.

## Why computer literacy matters

Computer literacy is not about being a ‚Äútech person.‚Äù It is about control over your time, your money, your reputation, and your opportunities. If you care about those, you care about this.

### What it gives you
- **Safety for the stuff that matters.** Your email, bank, photos, and messages live behind a sign in screen. With passkeys and phishing resistant MFA, one bad link does not snowball into identity theft.
- **Time back every week.** People who use AI and modern app features finish the boring parts in minutes and spend more time on the useful parts.
- **Better options at work.** Every role has a digital layer now. If you can read a chart, automate a tiny workflow, and steer AI, you become the person others rely on.

### What it protects you from
- **Account takeovers** that lock you out of email, banking, or social profiles.  
- **Costly mistakes** from AI outputs that sound confident but are wrong.  
- **Platform shocks** when a tool changes its rules or removes a feature.

### A quick thought experiment
Two people get the same spreadsheet. One asks Excel‚Äôs Copilot for trends plus a short explanation, then edits. Ten minutes. The other fiddles with formulas for an hour and is still not sure.

### The simple pitch
Computer literacy in 2026 is insurance for your identity, acceleration for your work, and a filter for the information firehose. Learn a few modern habits and you will feel it immediately.

## 1. Security that resists phishing

### What that means
Passwords are easy to steal. Even two factor codes can be tricked out of you with fake login pages. Phishing resistant sign in uses a cryptographic check between your device and the service so there is nothing useful to type into a fake form.

The simplest option is **passkeys**. A passkey lives on your device and you unlock it with your face, finger, or PIN. The private key never leaves your device.

If you want the primer:  
üëâ [What are passkeys and how do they work?](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/)

### What to do
1. **Turn on a passkey** for your main account.  
   - Google: [Use a passkey to sign in](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/13548313)  
   - Apple: [Use passkeys on iPhone and Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-passkeys-to-sign-in-to-websites-and-apps-iphf538ea8d0/ios) ¬∑ [About passkey security](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102195)  
   - Microsoft: [Signing in with a passkey](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/signing-in-with-a-passkey-09a49a86-ca47-406c-8acc-ed0e3c852c6d) ¬∑ [Windows passkeys overview](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/passkeys-overview-301c8944-5ea2-452b-9886-97e4d2ef4422)

2. **Add a hardware security key** for critical accounts.  
   - Yubico: [Getting started with YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/setup/)  
   - Google: [Use a security key for 2-Step Verification](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6103523)  
   - Microsoft: [Sign in with a security key](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/sign-in-to-your-account-with-a-security-key-b23a2a45-6ab8-4c86-9f22-bcadf60235aa)

3. **Avoid SMS codes where possible** and prefer phishing resistant prompts or keys.  
   - Microsoft Learn: [Require phishing-resistant MFA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/policy-admin-phish-resistant-mfa)

4. **Use an independent password manager** and store passkeys there too.  
   - Bitwarden: [Store and use passkeys](https://bitwarden.com/help/storing-passkeys/) ¬∑ [Passwordless with passkeys](https://bitwarden.com/passwordless-passkeys/)

Also keep in mind what I wrote in [Consolidation](https://sjg.io/writing/consolidation/) and [Consolidation Again](https://sjg.io/writing/consolidation-again/). Centralising everything behind one identity provider can be fragile. A standalone manager adds independence and resilience.

### Proof you did it
- You can see a registered passkey on your Google, Apple, or Microsoft security page.  
- You can sign in without typing a password.  
- From a different browser, the passkey prompt appears and no password box is needed.

## 2. Using AI like a collaborator

### What that means
AI is a conversational tool for thinking and drafting. You provide context and goals, it proposes structure and options, and you stay in charge of truth and tone. Treat outputs as a draft of reality, not reality.

### What to do
1. **Pick something real** you already do: a status email, a spreadsheet summary, or a plan.  
2. **State the goal and constraints** first, not just ‚Äúwrite it.‚Äù  
3. **Ask for structure, then detail**, and request an explanation of steps.  
4. **Edit the draft** and keep a short note of what you accepted or changed.

### Proof you did it
- You have a saved doc or sheet with AI comments or an explanation block.  
- You can explain one step the AI took in your own words.

## 3. Becoming a power user of your everyday tools

### What that means
Power users do not memorize everything. They know what their tools can do and how to get there quickly. Natural language features and light automation turn routine work into a sequence you can repeat.

### What to do
1. **Learn one feature this week** that raises your ceiling.  
   - Excel Copilot: [Get started](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-started-with-copilot-in-excel-d7110502-0334-4b4f-a175-a73abdfc118a)

2. **Connect two tools** with a small automation.  
   - Power Automate: [Create a cloud flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/get-started-logic-flow) ¬∑ [Training module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/get-started-flows/)  
   - Notion √ó Slack: [Integration](https://www.notion.com/integrations/slack) ¬∑ [How to connect](https://www.notion.com/help/slack)  
   - Zapier: [Zaps quick start](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/22234847450893-Zaps-quick-start-guide)

3. **Use the editor, not just the menu.** If Excel offers Python for a task, open the code editor and read it.  
   - Python editor basics: [Code editor](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/python-in-excel-code-editor-b74ac883-3bc1-4253-90cb-c1a09887acc1)

### Examples
- ‚ÄúWhen a Notion task moves to Done, post a Slack summary.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúGenerate a pivot table and chart for this dataset, then explain the formula.‚Äù

### Proof you did it
- You can re run the automation without rebuilding it.  
- You can open a recent file and show one feature you did not know last month.

## 4. Data and digital sensemaking

### What that means
You do not need to code daily, but you should be able to read a simple table, spot a pattern, question an outlier, and explain uncertainty. If you cannot tell where a number came from or when it refreshed, you cannot trust it.

### What to do
1. **Open a dashboard you already use** and ask three questions: What is this measuring, where did it come from, and when did it last update.  
2. **Create one honest chart** from your own data.  
   - Excel: [Create a chart](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-chart-from-start-to-finish-e7c6b9e7-4573-4d21-bd45-2d9f52e23c0f)  
   - Excel: [Create a PivotTable to analyze data](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-pivottable-to-analyze-worksheet-data-a9a84538-bfe9-40a9-a8e9-f99134456576)
3. **Write one sentence of interpretation** that notes at least one limitation.

### Examples
- ‚ÄúRevenue is up 8 percent quarter over quarter, but the dashboard excludes refunds.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúThe outlier likely reflects a backfilled batch on the 15th, not real growth.‚Äù

### Proof you did it
- You have a saved chart with a caption that states the metric, source, and refresh.  
- You can tell a non technical person what changed and why it matters.

---

## 5. Digital responsibility and awareness

### What that means
Everyday literacy includes spotting manipulated media, protecting your privacy by default, and choosing what you share. Provenance helps, but good habits matter more.

### What to do
1. **Verify before you share visual content.**  
   - Content provenance: [Content Credentials overview](https://contentcredentials.org/) ¬∑ [C2PA specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html)  
   - Check media: [CAI verification portal](https://verify.contentauthenticity.org/)  
   - Reverse images: [Google‚Äôs guide](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1325808)

2. **Tighten privacy defaults.** Turn off location sharing by default, review app permissions, and prune old data.

3. **Assume bias exists.** Ask who benefits or loses if you accept this claim as true.

### Proof you did it
- Your phone shows location services off for apps that do not need it.  
- You can show one verified image with provenance info or a reverse search result.

---

## 6. Ethics and critical thinking

### What that means
Good tech skills need judgment. Anyone can publish or generate convincing text and images. Your job is to be a careful editor of inputs and outputs.

### What to do
1. **Vet the source before you share.**  
   - Learn a quick method: Stanford‚Äôs [Civic Online Reasoning](https://cor.inquirygroup.org/)  
   - Compare media coverage: [Ground News](https://ground.news/)  
   - Learn to spot misquotes and bad stats: [Full Fact education](https://fullfact.org/education/)

2. **Double check claims fast.**  
   - Search verified checks: [Google Fact Check Explorer](https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/explorer)  
   - Daily corrections: [Full Fact latest](https://fullfact.org/latest/)  
   - Broad coverage: [Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/) ¬∑ [Reuters Fact Check](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/)

3. **Be critical of AI answers.**  
   - Ask for sources and open them.  
   - Ask for an alternative view or counterexample.  
   - Cross reference the same fact on at least two independent sites.  
   - Everyday guidance: Mozilla‚Äôs [Everyday AI Guide](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/insights/ai-guide/) ¬∑ UK ICO [Using AI safely](https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online-and-on-social-media/using-ai-safely/)

### Proof you did it
- You can show one claim you checked across two independent sources.  
- You can point to one AI answer you revised after finding a counterexample.
