title: "The 2026 Computer-Literate Bar"
date: 2025-10-21
description: "What being 'computer literate' actually means in 2026, why it matters, and exactly what to do about it."
---

It used to be enough to say you could use Word, send an email, and "do a spreadsheet."  
That is not computer literacy anymore. The bar has moved.

Being *computer literate* in 2026 means you can keep yourself secure, use AI as a partner, and work confidently across platforms.  
You do not need to be a programmer. You do need to understand how today‚Äôs tools think, talk, and connect.

This is a practical guide to getting there.

## Why computer literacy matters

Computer literacy is not about being a ‚Äútech person.‚Äù It is about control over your time, your money, your reputation, and your opportunities. If you care about those, you care about this.

### What it gives you
- **Safety for the stuff that matters.** Your email, bank, photos, and messages live behind a sign-in screen. With passkeys and phishing-resistant MFA, one bad link no longer spirals into identity theft.
- **Time back every week.** People who use AI and modern app features finish the boring parts in minutes and spend more time on the useful parts.
- **Better options at work.** Every role now has a digital layer. If you can read a chart, automate a small workflow, and steer AI, you become the person others rely on.

### What it protects you from
- **Account takeovers** that lock you out of email, banking, or social profiles.  
- **Costly mistakes** from AI outputs that sound confident but are wrong.  
- **Platform shocks** when a tool changes its rules or removes a feature.

### The simple pitch
Computer literacy in 2026 is insurance for your identity, acceleration for your work, and a filter for the information firehose. Learn a few modern habits and you will feel it immediately.

## 1. Security that resists phishing

### What that means
Passwords are easy to steal. Even two-factor codes can be tricked out of you with fake login pages. Phishing-resistant sign-in uses a cryptographic check between your device and the service so there is nothing useful to type into a fake form.

The simplest option is **passkeys**. A passkey lives on your device and you unlock it with your face, finger, or PIN. The private key never leaves your device.

If you want the primer:  
üëâ [What are passkeys and how do they work?](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/)

### What to do
1. **Turn on a passkey** for your main account.  
   - Google: [Use a passkey to sign in](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/13548313)  
   - Apple: [Use passkeys on iPhone and Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-passkeys-to-sign-in-to-websites-and-apps-iphf538ea8d0/ios) ¬∑ [About passkey security](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102195)  
   - Microsoft: [Signing in with a passkey](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/signing-in-with-a-passkey-09a49a86-ca47-406c-8acc-ed0e3c852c6d) ¬∑ [Windows passkeys overview](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/passkeys-overview-301c8944-5ea2-452b-9886-97e4d2ef4422)

2. **Add a hardware security key** for critical accounts.  
   - Yubico: [Getting started with YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/setup/)  
   - Google: [Use a security key for 2-Step Verification](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6103523)  
   - Microsoft: [Sign in with a security key](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/sign-in-to-your-account-with-a-security-key-b23a2a45-6ab8-4c86-9f22-bcadf60235aa)

3. **Avoid SMS codes where possible** and prefer phishing-resistant prompts or keys.  
   - Microsoft Learn: [Require phishing-resistant MFA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/policy-admin-phish-resistant-mfa)

4. **Review account recovery and backup codes.**  
   Store recovery keys and backup codes securely in a password manager. If SMS is listed as a fallback, remove it and add app-based or hardware methods instead.

5. **Use an independent password manager** that can hold passkeys.  
   - Bitwarden: [Store and use passkeys](https://bitwarden.com/help/storing-passkeys/) ¬∑ [Passwordless with passkeys](https://bitwarden.com/passwordless-passkeys/)

Also keep in mind what I wrote in [Consolidation](https://sjg.io/writing/consolidation/) and [Consolidation Again](https://sjg.io/writing/consolidation-again/). Centralising everything behind one identity provider can be fragile. A standalone manager adds independence and resilience.

### Proof you did it
- You can see a registered passkey on your Google, Apple, or Microsoft security page.  
- You can sign in without typing a password.  
- Your password manager holds backup codes and recovery keys, and SMS fallback is disabled.

## 2. Using AI like a collaborator

### What that means
AI is not a search engine or an autopilot. It is a partner for thinking and drafting. You describe your goal and context, it generates a structure or answer, and you stay responsible for accuracy and tone. Treat every confident output as a *draft of reality.*

### What to do
1. **Pick something real** you already do: a summary email, a small report, or analysing a table.  
2. **Explain your intent before the task.** ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to make this clear to non-technical readers‚Äù works better than ‚Äúwrite a report.‚Äù  
3. **Ask for reasoning and sources.** In ChatGPT, use `shift + enter` to add context, then ask ‚Äúcite your sources.‚Äù  
4. **Check citations.** Follow at least two links to verify they exist and are relevant.  
5. **Edit for your own voice.** Keep the structure, fix the detail.

### Best tools and how to get the most
- **ChatGPT:** use GPT-4 or GPT-4-turbo. Include context, examples of your writing, and the instruction ‚Äúshow citations.‚Äù  
  - [ChatGPT Help: How to use chat](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-how-to-use-chatgpt)  
  - [ChatGPT Plus guide](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825454-how-to-upgrade-to-chatgpt-plus)
- **Microsoft Copilot:**  
  - Excel: [Get started](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-started-with-copilot-in-excel-d7110502-0334-4b4f-a175-a73abdfc118a)  
  - Word: [Copilot in Word](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot-word)  
  - Outlook: [Summarise an email thread](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/summarize-an-email-thread-with-copilot-a79873f2-396b-46dc-b852-7fe5947ab640)
- **Google Workspace (Gemini):**  
  - [Write, organise, and summarise with Gemini](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/13976835)

### Examples
- ‚ÄúSummarise this spreadsheet in plain language with three bullet points and one chart. Explain where the data looks unreliable.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúWrite a 200 word draft for our team update in my tone: conversational, factual, British.‚Äù

### Proof you did it
- You have a document or chat log showing both output and your edits.  
- You verified at least two citations or sources.

## 3. Becoming a power user of your everyday tools

### What that means
Power users get repeatable results by knowing what their tools can do and how to automate small, boring steps. You do not need to know everything ‚Äî you need to know how to ask and reuse.

### What to do
1. **Learn one feature this week** that raises your ceiling.  
   - Excel Copilot: [Get started](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-started-with-copilot-in-excel-d7110502-0334-4b4f-a175-a73abdfc118a)  
   - Google Sheets Explore: [Analyse data instantly](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6280499)
2. **Connect two tools** with an automation.  
   - Power Automate: [Create a cloud flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/get-started-logic-flow)  
   - Zapier: [Zaps quick start guide](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/22234847450893-Zaps-quick-start-guide)
3. **Adopt a time saver.**  
   - Text expansion: use built-in shortcuts (macOS Text Replacements, Windows PowerToys Paste).  
   - Clipboard history: [Windows Clipboard history](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-clipboard-history-06fa12b5-11c0-49c1-91f5-8b0ce23a8f27) ¬∑ [Paste for Mac](https://pasteapp.io/).

### Examples
- ‚ÄúWhen I add a row in my budget sheet, it updates my tracker.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúI type /sig and it inserts my full signature automatically.‚Äù

### Proof you did it
- You can trigger one saved automation and it works.  
- You replaced one manual weekly task with a shortcut or text expansion.

## 4. Data and digital sensemaking

### What that means
You do not need to be a data scientist, but you should be able to look at a chart and know what it measures, what might be missing, and how confident you should be. If you cannot say where the number came from, you should not trust it.

### What to do
1. **Open a dashboard you use often** ‚Äî maybe fitness data, spending, or energy usage ‚Äî and ask:
   - What exactly is being measured?  
   - What is it divided by?  
   - What period does it cover?  
   - When did it last update?
2. **Create one simple chart** from your own data.
   - Excel: [Create a chart](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-chart-from-start-to-finish-e7c6b9e7-4573-4d21-bd45-2d9f52e23c0f)
   - Google Sheets: [Add and edit a chart](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/63824)
3. **Add one honest note.** Write a line about what might make the data misleading.

### Examples
- ‚ÄúSteps are up 10 percent, but the watch battery died two days this week.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúSpending looks down because one refund hit this month.‚Äù

### Proof you did it
- The chart has a clear title, source, and a short note on limits.  
- You can explain the four points: what, divided by, when, and freshness.

## 5. Digital responsibility and awareness

### What that means
Start cynical. Assume every WhatsApp forward, TikTok clip, or Instagram reel is fake until you can prove it. That mindset keeps you safer. Digital responsibility is about privacy hygiene and source skepticism ‚Äî the two most protective habits online.

### What to do
1. **Run your privacy checkups.**
   - Google: [Privacy Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup) ¬∑ [Security Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup)
   - Apple: [App Tracking Transparency and privacy settings](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT212025)
   - Android: [Privacy Dashboard](https://support.google.com/android/answer/10117042)
2. **Tighten sharing defaults.**
   - Turn off location sharing unless essential.
   - Review which apps have access to contacts, camera, and microphone.
3. **Verify before you share any media.**
   - Content provenance: [Content Credentials](https://contentcredentials.org/)  
   - Verify images: [CAI verification portal](https://verify.contentauthenticity.org/)  
   - Reverse image search: [Google‚Äôs guide](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1325808)

### Proof you did it
- You completed a privacy checkup and removed at least one app permission.  
- You verified an image or video before reposting it.

---

## 6. Ethics and critical thinking

### What that means
Good computer literacy is not blind trust. It is healthy skepticism backed by a method. Anyone can publish or generate convincing text and images. You should check who is talking, what evidence they have, how others cover it, and whether the AI might be confidently wrong.

### What to do
1. **Vet the source before you share.**
   - Use the SIFT method: **Stop, Investigate, Find better coverage, Trace the source.**
   - Quick learning: Stanford [Civic Online Reasoning](https://cor.inquirygroup.org/)
   - Compare coverage bias: [Ground News](https://ground.news/)
   - Learn to spot misquotes: [Full Fact education](https://fullfact.org/education/)
2. **Double check claims quickly.**
   - [Google Fact Check Explorer](https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/explorer)
   - [Full Fact latest](https://fullfact.org/latest/)
   - [Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/) ¬∑ [Reuters Fact Check](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/)
3. **Be critical of AI answers.**
   - Ask for sources and open them.
   - Ask the same question in two tools (for example, ChatGPT and Gemini) and compare.
   - Ask for an alternative view or counterexample.
   - Everyday guidance: Mozilla‚Äôs [Everyday AI Guide](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/insights/ai-guide/) ¬∑ UK ICO [Using AI safely](https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online-and-on-social-media/using-ai-safely/)

### Proof you did it
- You can show one claim you checked across two sources.  
- You corrected or refined an AI answer after cross-checking.

## What to do today

Do not file this away as ‚Äúsomething to look into later.‚Äù  
Open your laptop or phone now and do these three things:

1. **Turn on a passkey.**  
   Choose your platform and follow the official steps:  
   [Google](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/13548313) ¬∑ [Apple](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-passkeys-to-sign-in-to-websites-and-apps-iphf538ea8d0/ios) ¬∑ [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/signing-in-with-a-passkey-09a49a86-ca47-406c-8acc-ed0e3c852c6d)

2. **Use an AI tool for something real.**  
   Write a message, analyse a sheet, or plan a note with help from AI.  
   Try [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [Copilot in Word](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot-word), or [Gemini in Docs](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/13976835). Treat it like a conversation, not a command.

3. **Learn one new trick in an app you already use.**  
   In Excel, ask Copilot to explain a formula or generate a chart. In Google Sheets, ask Gemini to find a pattern in your data.

Do those three things today and you will already be operating at the 2026 computer-literate level.

This is not a complete list of everything it takes to be computer-literate in 2026.  
It is the gap between being comfortable in 2024 and being confident in 2026 ‚Äî the skills most people should refine now.
