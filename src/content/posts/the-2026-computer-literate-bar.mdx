It used to be enough to say you could use Word, send an email, and "do a spreadsheet." That is not computer literacy anymore. The bar has moved.

Over the last few months I have been working on this idea of a 2026 computer‚Äëliteracy bar while thinking about hiring and talent in an AI‚Äëpowered workplace. It is not "coming soon." It is here today. Employers expect core skills to shift fast and most jobs already require digital capability (see the World Economic Forum‚Äôs *Future of Jobs*).  

Years ago I was telling people Power BI skills would become the new Excel. This shift is like that, only bigger. AI and modern tooling are changing how people write, analyse, and decide, and the time savings show up quickly in the flow of daily work.

This applies to everyone. I mean the stay‚Äëat‚Äëhome parent, the high‚Äërate lawyer, the accountant, the programmer, and the health worker. Most jobs now require at least medium digital skills and the share of low‚Äëdigital jobs keeps shrinking.

Being computer literate in 2026 means you can keep yourself secure, use AI as a partner, and work confidently across platforms. You do not need to be a programmer. You do need to understand how today‚Äôs tools think, talk, and connect.

This is a practical guide to getting there.

## Why computer literacy matters

Computer literacy is not about being a ‚Äútech person.‚Äù It is about control over your time, your money, your reputation, and your opportunities. If you care about those, you care about this.

### What it gives you

Being computer literate gives you back control. It keeps your digital life safe, makes your day more efficient, and opens doors professionally. Your email, bank accounts, photos, and messages all live behind a sign-in page, and with passkeys and phishing-resistant MFA, one careless click no longer turns into an identity theft nightmare. You win back hours each week by using AI and modern app features that take the boring, repetitive work off your hands, leaving more space for the tasks that actually need your attention. And at work, where every role now has a digital layer, it is the people who can read a chart, automate a small workflow, and steer AI with confidence who others rely on and who move ahead fastest.

### What it protects you from

It also protects you from the things that quietly erode trust and time online. Strong security and a healthy dose of digital scepticism help prevent account takeovers that can lock you out of email, banking, or social profiles. Clearer habits with AI reduce costly mistakes that come from accepting confident-sounding but wrong answers. And a broader awareness of how platforms change protects you from sudden ‚Äúrule shifts‚Äù that can make familiar tools vanish overnight. In short, literacy turns uncertainty into confidence.


### In summary
Computer literacy in 2026 is insurance for your identity, acceleration for your work, and a filter for the information firehose. Learn a few modern habits and you will feel it immediately.

## 1. Security that resists phishing

### What that means
Passwords are easy to steal. Even two‚Äëfactor codes can be tricked out of you with fake sign‚Äëin pages. Phishing‚Äëresistant sign‚Äëin uses a cryptographic check between your device and the service, so there is nothing useful to type into a fake form.

Verizon‚Äôs *2025 Data Breach Investigations Report* lists stolen credentials and social engineering among the top breach causes ([Verizon, 2025 DBIR](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/)). That is why moving beyond passwords matters.

The strongest option for most people is a **passkey** or a **FIDO2 hardware key**.  
These prove your identity with a cryptographic challenge that can only be completed by your real device.  
They cannot be intercepted by fake websites, reused, or guessed.

If you want the primer:  
üëâ [What are passkeys and how do they work?](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/)

### What to do
- **Turn on a passkey** for your main account  
  Use the official guides:  
  ‚Ä¢ Google: [Use a passkey to sign in](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/13548313)  
  ‚Ä¢ Apple: [Use passkeys on iPhone and Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-passkeys-to-sign-in-to-websites-and-apps-iphf538ea8d0/ios) ¬∑ [About passkey security](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102195)  
  ‚Ä¢ Microsoft: [Signing in with a passkey](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/signing-in-with-a-passkey-09a49a86-ca47-406c-8acc-ed0e3c852c6d) ¬∑ [Windows passkeys overview](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/passkeys-overview-301c8944-5ea2-452b-9886-97e4d2ef4422)

- **Add a hardware security key** for critical accounts  
  A FIDO2 or WebAuthn‚Äëcompatible key (for example a [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/setup/) or [Google Titan key](https://store.google.com/product/titan_security_key)) gives you a physical device that must be present to sign in.  
  It is ideal for banking, email, and admin roles.  
  Unlike phone codes, it cannot be phished or SIM‚Äëswapped.  
  ‚Ä¢ Microsoft: [Sign in with a security key](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/sign-in-to-your-account-with-a-security-key-b23a2a45-6ab8-4c86-9f22-bcadf60235aa)

- **Choose the right MFA methods**

  | **Method** | **Recommended?** | **Why** |
  |--------|---------------|-----|
  | **Passkeys / FIDO2 hardware keys** | ‚úÖ **Best** | Fully phishing‚Äëresistant, cryptographic, no shared secret. |
  | **Authenticator app codes (TOTP)** (Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator, 1Password, Authy) | ‚úÖ **Good** | Strong codes generated on device; still phishable if you type them into a fake page. |
  | **Push approvals** (Microsoft or Okta push) | ‚úÖ **Good, with care** | Convenient, but tap‚Äëfatigue can cause accidental approvals. Only approve if you just attempted to sign in. |
  | **Email codes** | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Weak** | Email can itself be compromised. Use only as a recovery method. |
  | **SMS / text codes** | ‚ùå **Avoid where possible** | Vulnerable to SIM‚Äëswap and phishing interception. |
  | **Security questions** | ‚ùå **Never use** | Easy to guess or scrape from public data. |

- **Review account recovery and backup codes**  
  Store recovery keys and backup codes securely in a password manager.  
  If SMS is listed as a fallback, remove it and add app‚Äëbased or hardware methods instead.  
  ‚Ä¢ Bitwarden: [Store and use passkeys](https://bitwarden.com/help/storing-passkeys/) ¬∑ [Passwordless with passkeys](https://bitwarden.com/passwordless-passkeys/)

- **Use an independent password manager**  
  Password managers create unique credentials and can also store your passkeys.  
  They keep you independent of one vendor‚Äôs ecosystem and make recovery simpler.  
  Open, trusted options: [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) and [1Password](https://1password.com/).

### Proof you did it
- You see a registered passkey or hardware key listed on your Google, Apple, or Microsoft security page.  
- You can sign in without typing a password.  
- Your password manager holds recovery codes, and SMS fallback is removed.  
- If prompted for MFA, you tap a hardware key or confirm in an authenticator app, not via text.

### Why this matters
- 60% of breaches in 2025 involved the human element or stolen credentials.  
- SMS and voice are weak factors; move to phishing‚Äëresistant methods and remove weak fallbacks.  

Also see my earlier posts on [Consolidation](https://sjg.io/writing/consolidation/) and [Consolidation Again](https://sjg.io/writing/consolidation-again/). Centralised logins magnify the impact of weak MFA.

## 2. Using AI like a collaborator

### What that means
AI is not a search engine or an autopilot. It is a partner for thinking and drafting. In ChatGPT, **GPT‚Äë5** automatically chooses between **Chat** (quick conversation) and **Thinking** (deeper reasoning). Treat every confident output as a draft that still needs sources and edits.

When you need the web, use **Search**. When you need a documented report with citations, use **Deep Research**. When you need to process data or check maths, use **Data Analysis**. This is not a separate mode; it activates when you upload a file or ask for calculation, graphs, or inspection. The clearer you state your intent, the better these tools work.

### What to do
- **Pick something real** you already do (an email summary, a report, a data problem).  
- **State goal and audience first.** "Make this clear to non‚Äëtechnical readers and keep it factual" beats "write a report."  
- **Choose the right tool or mode.**  
  ‚Ä¢ **Search** for recent facts with links.  
  ‚Ä¢ **Deep Research** for longer, cited write‚Äëups.  
  ‚Ä¢ **Data Analysis** by uploading a file or asking for calculation; it runs code and shows the working.  
  ‚Ä¢ **GPT‚Äë5 Thinking** for problems that need more reasoning.  
- **Ask for reasoning and sources.** "List sources for each claim and show your steps." Open the links and check them.  
- **Edit for your voice.** Keep the structure, fix the details, and note what you changed.

### Good vs bad practices

| **Practice** | **Do** | **Do not** | **Why it matters** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Define the task** | Give goal, audience, constraints, examples | Use a one‚Äëline ‚Äúdo this‚Äù prompt | Clear intent gives better structure and fewer rewrites. |
| **Pick the right tool** | Use **Search** for web answers, **Deep Research** for multi‚Äësource write‚Äëups, **Data Analysis** for maths/files, **GPT‚Äë5 Thinking** for complex reasoning | Expect plain Chat to handle everything | Each is built for a different job. Data Analysis executes code; Deep Research adds citations. |
| **Citations** | Require citations when facts matter and open them | Copy text with unverified ‚Äúcitations‚Äù | Verification closes the loop. |
| **Critique** | Challenge the draft. Ask for alternatives and counterexamples | Copy and paste the first output | Refining through dialogue improves quality. |
| **Maths and data** | Upload data or use **Data Analysis** so the maths executes visibly | Trust plain chat for arithmetic or joins | Chat alone can be confidently wrong. Data Analysis shows the steps. |
| **Thinking models** | Let **GPT‚Äë5 Thinking** tackle reasoning‚Äëheavy questions | Rush everything through Chat | Thinking spends more time reasoning and planning. |
| **Privacy** | Avoid pasting secrets. Use **Temporary Chats** or manage **Data Controls** | Treat chat like a private notepad | You control history and training. Use the settings. |
| **Upgrade when it matters** | Use **Plus** or **Pro** for access to GPT‚Äë5 and research tools | Assume the free tier is identical | Paid tiers unlock higher limits, reasoning, and citations. |

### Best tools and how to get the most
- **ChatGPT (GPT‚Äë5)**  
  ‚Ä¢ Tools: **Search**, **Deep Research**, **Data Analysis** (available via the tool picker or when context demands).  
  ‚Ä¢ Plans: [ChatGPT Plus](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825454-how-to-upgrade-to-chatgpt-plus) and [ChatGPT Pro](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8424158-chatgpt-pro-plan-overview) for higher limits and access to GPT‚Äë5, Thinking, and research tools.  
  ‚Ä¢ Best practice: be explicit, iterate, and ask the model to show its reasoning or assumptions.
- **Microsoft Copilot**  
  ‚Ä¢ Excel: [Get started](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-started-with-copilot-in-excel-d7110502-0334-4b4f-a175-a73abdfc118a)  
  ‚Ä¢ Word: [Copilot in Word](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot-word)  
  ‚Ä¢ Outlook: [Summarise a thread](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/summarize-an-email-thread-with-copilot-a79873f2-396b-46dc-b852-7fe5947ab640)
- **Google Workspace (Gemini)**  
  ‚Ä¢ Docs and Sheets: [Gemini for Workspace](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/13976835)

### Examples
- ‚ÄúSummarise this spreadsheet in plain language with three bullet points and one chart. Explain where the data looks unreliable, then give me an alternative chart.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúWrite a 200‚Äëword draft for our team update in my voice. Add links for each claim. Then show a counterargument and a short reply.‚Äù

### Proof you did it
- You saved a document or chat that shows the AI‚Äôs output and your edits.  
- You verified at least two cited sources.  
- You opened **View analysis** for Data Analysis and saw the executed code.

### Why this matters
Used with intent, AI saves time and improves clarity. Used blindly, it can be confidently wrong.

## 3. Becoming a power user of your everyday tools

### What that means
Power users get repeatable results by knowing what their tools can do and by automating small, boring steps. You do not need to know everything. You need to know how to ask and how to reuse.

### What to do
- **Learn one feature this week** that raises your ceiling.  
  ‚Ä¢ Excel Copilot: [Get started](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-started-with-copilot-in-excel-d7110502-0334-4b4f-a175-a73abdfc118a)  
  ‚Ä¢ Google Sheets Explore: [Analyse data instantly](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6280499)
- **Connect two tools** with an automation.  
  ‚Ä¢ Power Automate: [Create a cloud flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/get-started-logic-flow)  
  ‚Ä¢ Zapier: [Zaps quick start guide](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/22234847450893-Zaps-quick-start-guide)
- **Adopt a time saver.**  
  ‚Ä¢ Text expansion: macOS **Text Replacements**; **Outlook Quick Parts**; **Word Quick Parts**; **Gmail Templates** ([how to set up templates](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/281059)).  
  ‚Ä¢ Clipboard history: [Windows Clipboard history](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-clipboard-history-06fa12b5-11c0-49c1-91f5-8b0ce23a8f27); optional Mac tool [Paste](https://pasteapp.io/).

### Examples
- ‚ÄúWhen I add a row in my budget sheet, it updates my tracker.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúI type /sig and it inserts my full signature automatically.‚Äù

### Proof you did it
- You can trigger one saved automation and it works.  
- You replaced one manual weekly task with a shortcut or text expansion.

### Why this matters
Small automations compound. One saved minute a day is almost a full day a year.

## 4. Data and digital sensemaking

### What that means
You do not need to be a data scientist, but you should be able to look at a chart and know what it measures, what might be missing, and how confident you should be. If you cannot say where the number came from, you should not trust it.

### What to do
- **Open a dashboard you use often** (for example fitness data, spending, or energy usage) and ask:  
  ‚Ä¢ What exactly is being measured?  
  ‚Ä¢ What is it divided by?  
  ‚Ä¢ What period does it cover?  
  ‚Ä¢ When did it last update?
- **Create one simple chart** from your own data.  
  ‚Ä¢ Excel: [Create a chart](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-chart-from-start-to-finish-e7c6b9e7-4573-4d21-bd45-2d9f52e23c0f)  
  ‚Ä¢ Google Sheets: [Add and edit a chart](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/63824)
- **Add one honest note.** Write a line about what might make the data misleading.

### Examples
- ‚ÄúSteps are up 10%, but the watch battery died two days this week.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúSpending looks down because one refund hit this month.‚Äù

### Proof you did it
- The chart has a clear title, source, and a short note on limits.  
- You can explain the four points: what, divided by, when, and freshness.

### Why this matters
If you cannot explain the metric, denominator, period, and freshness, you should not act on it.

---

## 5. Digital responsibility and awareness

### What that means
Start cynical. Assume every WhatsApp forward, TikTok clip, or Instagram reel is fake until you can prove it. That mindset keeps you safer. Digital responsibility is about privacy hygiene and source scepticism, which are two of the most protective habits online.

### What to do
- **Run your privacy checkups.**  
  ‚Ä¢ Google: [Privacy Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup) ¬∑ [Security Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup)  
  ‚Ä¢ Apple: [App Tracking Transparency and privacy settings](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT212025)  
  ‚Ä¢ Android: [Privacy Dashboard](https://support.google.com/android/answer/10117042)
- **Tighten sharing defaults.**  
  On your phone, turn off location unless essential. Review app permissions for contacts, photos, camera, and microphone. Don't blindly accept all those permission popups from the apps, actually consider: do I want this company having access to this thing?

  Most sites now show a cookie notice the first time you visit. The right choice on those banners is almost always **Reject**. Accepting ‚Äúall cookies‚Äù lets the site and its partners track your behaviour across the web, build advertising profiles, and often share that data with brokers you have never heard of. Rejecting optional cookies means the site still works but limits how much of your activity can be stitched together between sites. The only cookies you truly need are the essential ones that keep you signed in or remember your settings.

- **Verify before you share media.**  
  ‚Ä¢ Content provenance: [Content Credentials](https://contentcredentials.org/)  
  ‚Ä¢ Verify images: [CAI verification portal](https://verify.contentauthenticity.org/)  
  ‚Ä¢ Reverse image search: [Google‚Äôs guide](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1325808)

### Proof you did it
- You completed a privacy checkup and removed at least one app permission.  
- You verified an image or video before reposting it.

### Why this matters
Healthy scepticism prevents you from spreading fakes and leaking private data.

---

## 6. Ethics and critical thinking

### What that means
Good computer literacy is not blind trust. It is healthy scepticism backed by a simple method. Anyone can publish or generate convincing text and images. You should check who is talking, what evidence they have, how others cover it, and whether the AI might be confidently wrong.

### What to do
- **Vet the source before you share.**  
  Use the SIFT method: **Stop, Investigate the source, Find better coverage, Trace the claim**.  
  ‚Ä¢ Learn quickly: Stanford [Civic Online Reasoning](https://cor.inquirygroup.org/)  
  ‚Ä¢ Compare coverage bias: [Ground News](https://ground.news/)  
  ‚Ä¢ Spot misquotes and bad stats: [Full Fact education](https://fullfact.org/education/)
- **Double check claims quickly.**  
  ‚Ä¢ [Google Fact Check Explorer](https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/explorer)  
  ‚Ä¢ [Full Fact latest](https://fullfact.org/latest/)  
  ‚Ä¢ [Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/) ¬∑ [Reuters Fact Check](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/)
- **Be critical of AI answers.**  
  Ask for sources and open them. Ask the same question in two tools and compare. Ask for an alternative view or a counterexample. For everyday guidance, see Mozilla‚Äôs [Everyday AI Guide](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/insights/ai-guide/) and the UK ICO‚Äôs [Using AI safely](https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online-and-on-social-media/using-ai-safely/).

### Proof you did it
- You can show one claim you checked across two sources.  
- You corrected or refined an AI answer after cross‚Äëchecking.

### Why this matters
Anyone can generate convincing content. Your edge is sound judgement.

## What to do today

Do not file this away as "something to look into later."  
Open your laptop or phone now and do these four things:

- **Turn on a passkey.**  
  Choose your platform and follow the official steps:  
  [Google](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/13548313) ¬∑ [Apple](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-passkeys-to-sign-in-to-websites-and-apps-iphf538ea8d0/ios) ¬∑ [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/signing-in-with-a-passkey-09a49a86-ca47-406c-8acc-ed0e3c852c6d)

- **Use an AI tool for something real.**  
  Write a message, analyse a sheet, or plan a note with help from AI.  
  Try [ChatGPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-how-to-use-chatgpt), [Copilot in Word](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot-word), or [Gemini in Docs](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/13976835). Treat it like a conversation, not a command.

- **Learn one new trick in an app you already use.**  
  In Excel, ask Copilot to explain a formula or create a quick chart. In Google Sheets, ask Gemini to find a pattern in your data.

- **Practice healthy cynicism on social media.**  
  Pick one post from your Facebook or X feed that sounds dramatic or surprising. Assume it is false until proven true.  
  ‚Ä¢ Search the claim in [Google Fact Check Explorer](https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/explorer) or [Full Fact](https://fullfact.org/latest/).  
  ‚Ä¢ Check image provenance at [verify.contentauthenticity.org](https://verify.contentauthenticity.org/) or run a reverse image search.  
  ‚Ä¢ Only share it if you can verify the original source.

Do those four things today and you will already be operating at the 2026 computer‚Äëliterate level.
