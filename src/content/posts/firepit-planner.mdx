# Firepit Planner

**UPDATE:** I did in fact build the firepit per the plan output by the script and it worked out well! Here's the construction process and the finished result:

Out in the forest school woods, I wanted to build a proper firepit. Something solid, lasting, and safe for group sessions. I'd already picked up a steel liner from Amazon, but that left one question: how many bricks do you actually need to build the surround, and how should they be laid out?

I used the opportunity to have Cursor knock me out a one-time tool to solve it. It takes the liner and brick dimensions, makes a few layout assumptions, then calculates the full Bill of Materials automatically: number of bricks, courses, radius offsets, total cost, and even a simple visual plan.

It's up here if you fancy a look:

The script's simple and fast. You feed it your liner dimensions, brick specs, and construction details, and it figures out the rest, producing a neat plan that makes sure you're buying the right amount of materials before heading to the yard.

All in all, this took me just under an hour with Cursor. I got to Minimum Viable Experiment in about 5 minutes, and the remaining time was fiddling and polishing it that really wasn't necessary!

The firepit's going in a small clearing among the beeches, right in the centre of the forest school site. Once the brickwork's done and the liner's dropped in, it'll become a proper gathering spot. Somewhere for stories, food, and the smell of wood smoke hanging in the air.
